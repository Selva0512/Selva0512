# About Me

I am a web developer with expertise in React, UX design, HTML, CSS, WordPress, and Node.js. While I have not yet gained formal work experience, I am passionate about creating visually appealing and user-friendly web applications. My interests outside of development include watching anime, following football, and exploring creative design.
